## Treasure Map

# UPDATE

# Instructions
I am going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called ```map```.

This ```map``` contains a nested list.
When ```map``` is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```
In the starting code, we have used new lines (```\n```) to format the three rows into a square, like this:
```
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
```
This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.
